# Interrupt-Controller-Using-a-State-Machine
This Verilog module implements a programmable Interrupt Controller with a built-in priority selection mechanism, controlled via the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus interface. The controller monitors multiple interrupt sources and determines, based on priority registers, which interrupt should be serviced next.
